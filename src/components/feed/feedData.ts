  comment: `Had an enjoyable meal at Yakiniku Yokocho. The meat was very tasty and delicious. We ordered 3 small portions of meats and one side + large rice to share between 2 people. With beer $65 in total. It was perfect for us. Highly recommend the Boneless Beef Rib and Pork Neck. Not so much the outskirt which was in comparison more chewy. 

  It’s a cozy little place and staff was very attentive and fast with service. If you go rush hour might need to wait. It is very popular. 
  
  The place does get a bit smokey when it’s full, the ventilation tubes weren’t as effective as it should be.
  
  We will surely return, this looks to be a keeper and an awesome regular spot to eat.
  
  Note that the BBQ is with gas not charcoal. And 90 mins meal time limit, which was more than enough for us.`,
